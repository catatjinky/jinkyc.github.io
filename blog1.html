        <h1>My Full Stack Web Developer Journey</h1>
        <p>As someone who always had an interest in technology, I found myself drawn towards web development. <br>
            After completing my computer science degree, I decided to pursue a career in web development <br>
            and became a full stack web developer.</p>
        <p>My journey to becoming a full stack web developer was not easy, but it was incredibly rewarding. <br>
            Here are some of the steps that I took to get where I am today:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learning the Basics</li>
                <p>I started by learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are the building blocks of web development, <br>
                    and it was important to have a solid foundation before moving on to more advanced topics.</p>
                <li>Front-end Development</li>
                <p>I focused on front-end development and learned how to create user interfaces using popular frameworks like React and Angular. <br>
                    I also learned how to make websites responsive and accessible across different devices and screen sizes.</p>
                <li>Back-end Development</li>
                <p>Once I felt comfortable with front-end development, I moved on to back-end development. I learned how to use Node.js <br>
                    and other server-side technologies to build complex web applications and APIs.</p>
                <li>Databases and Data Structures</li>
                <p>To make my web applications more robust, I learned about databases and data structures. I became proficient in SQL and NoSQL <br>
                    databases and learned how to use them to store and retrieve data.</p>
                <li>Full Stack Development</li>
                <p>Finally, I combined all of my knowledge and skills to become a full stack web developer. I learned how to integrate front-end <br>
                    and back-end technologies to create fully functional web applications.</p>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Throughout my journey, I encountered challenges and obstacles, but I was determined to overcome them. <br>
            I spent countless hours reading documentation, watching tutorials, and practicing my skills. I also <br>
            sought out mentorship and guidance from more experienced developers.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was keeping up with the constantly evolving landscape of web development. <br>
            New frameworks, libraries, and technologies emerge all the time, and it can be overwhelming to keep up. <br>
            However, I found that by staying curious and dedicated to learning, I was able to adapt and stay ahead of the curve.</p>
        <p>Another challenge was dealing with imposter syndrome. As a self-taught developer, I often felt like I didn't belong in the tech industry. <br>
            However, I realized that this was a common feeling among many developers, regardless of their background or experience. <br>
            I learned to overcome my doubts and insecurities by focusing on my strengths and continuously improving my skills.</p>
        <p>Overall, my journey to becoming a full stack web developer was a challenging but fulfilling experience. <br>
            I am grateful for the knowledge and skills that I have gained and am excited to continue learning and growing in this dynamic field.</p>
